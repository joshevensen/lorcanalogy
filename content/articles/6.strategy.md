## Resource Management

Lorcana Resources: Cards, Ink, and Lore

### Card Advantage

This refers to one player having more cards than their opponent. Players with more cards in hand, on board, and in ink has card advantage.

Drawing cards or making your opponent discard cards helps you gain and maintain card advantage.

Some cards have a neutral advantage where you have to discard a card to get your opponent to discard a card. This is known as card trading.

Cards that add ink from your deck can also help card advantage.

### Ink Advantage

The player who most efficiently uses their ink will be ahead in tempo. This isn't about how much ink you have on the board (that's card advantage). But instead how effectively you use the ink you have.

Gaining ink advantage is about answering your opponent's board as efficiently as possible. Compare the ink cost of what your doing compared to what your achieving.

Shift allows you to trade card advantage for ink advantage.

Singing allows you to trade lore advantage for ink advantage

Making an efficient trade in challenges will also give you an ink advantage.

Prevent leaving ink unused during your turn.

### Lore Advantage

This is simply which player has the most lore.

How much lore can often dictate whether you have to play offensively or defensively and will lead to your gameplay decisions.
