## Rules

- Your deck must have at least 60 cards in it.
- Your deck can’t contain more than 4 copies of any single card.
  - Different versions of a character count as different cards, so having 4 copies of Kida – Royal Warrior in your deck doesn’t keep you from adding up to 4 copies of Kida – Atlantean!
- Your deck can only contain cards from 1 or 2 inks.
- No cards can be in the banned list
