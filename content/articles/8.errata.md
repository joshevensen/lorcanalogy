## Bucky – Squirrel Squeak Tutor

Ursula’s Return gave Bucky players the opportunity to discard multiple cards from opponents’ hands as early as turn 2 while building up a board that was very difficult to interact with, creating a stressful environment that just wasn’t fun. Ward also made Bucky close to untouchable, taking away player agency to deal with a powerful and cheap threat. For these reasons, we’re increasing Bucky’s cost to 3 and removing Ward from him. Additionally, we feel that requiring Shift better represents the Floodborn experience, as many decks utilizing Bucky have mostly ignored using the Shift mechanic (outside of one sinister bird).

- **Date**: Aug 9, 2024
- **Set**: Rise of the Floodborn
- **Change Cost**: 2 to 3
- **Remove Keyword:** Ward
- **Change Ability:** **Squeak** Whenever you play a Floodborn character, if you used Shift to play them, each opponent chooses and discards a card.
