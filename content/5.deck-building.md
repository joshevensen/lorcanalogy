# Deck Building

## Draw

**Draw simply means taking the top card from your deck and putting it into your hand**. Cards that allow you to draw are very powerful. Having more cards than your opponent is called “hand advantage” or “card advantage”. The more cards you have, the more options you have.

## Look At Top X

This is another common card game ability. You **take the top x number of cards from your deck and look at them**. It’s normally followed by another action.

Most of the time you then choose to put the cards back on the top or bottom in any order you’d prefer. Sometimes you can keep one of those cards but must discard another. It’s a good way to draw cards or plan your next turns.

## Banish

Banishing a character or item means **sending it to that player’s discard pile**. It’s a powerful ability that can ruin a game plan by sending a high-cost character thats _just_ about to win a game to the trash!

While it costs a lot, it can be absolutely worth it. In other card games, this will often have a limit on the cost of a character that it can banish to stop it from being overpowered.

## Return From Discard

In the same way that having a card banished can be a game-breaker, so can returning that card. Some abilities allow you to return either a character or item back to your hand.

A slight variation on this is one that lets you take a card from a chosen player’s discard and shuffle it back into their deck. That allows you to either: –

1. Stop your opponent from returning a card from their discard straight away
2. Search your deck for that card in the future or hope you draw it soon

## Return to Hand

Another tricksy ability that puts a card back in the owner’s hand. While not as powerful as **Banish**, it wastes time and ink by forcing the player to pay again if they want to use the card.

You can also use this ability to return your own cards to hand. You might do this so you can play them again readied so they can’t be challenged, or to use an on play ability again.
